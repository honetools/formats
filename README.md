# Hone formats and protocols

This repo contains the specifications for Hone formats and protocols. In particular, there are the following pieces.



## [Service API](Service%20API.md)

This is the API to the Hone cloud service.



## [Device API](Device%20API.md)

This is the API that individual devices should be implement, so you could edit them in real time with the Hone tool over a local Bonjour connection. The official Hone libraries that you link in your app implement this.



## [Document format](Document%20v2.md)

This is the format of Hone documents that you edit with the Hone tool.
