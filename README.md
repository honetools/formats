# Sway formats and protocols

This repo contains the specifications for Sway formats and protocols. In particular, there are the following pieces.



## Service API

This is the API to the Sway cloud service.



## Device API

This is the API that individual devices should be implement, so you could edit them in real time with the Sway tool over a local Bonjour connection. The official Sway libraries that you link in your app implement this.



## [Document format](Document.md)

This is the format of Sway documents that you edit with the Sway tool.
